# Autonomous-Vechicle-Detection
This capstone project was created towards the fullfilment of the Computer Vision Course at UNSW

# Description
This capstone project is aimed towards the application of computer vision techniques aimed at aiding autonomous vechicles in the following:
* Estimation of Distance of the oncoming Vehicle
* Object Detection and recognition.
* Estimation of Velocity of the oncmoing Vechicle
* Lane Detection of the autonomous Vechicle

# Tasks
* The first part of the project is aimed at the estimation of the objects in front of the car
    * For this task, there are two implementations
       * Vechicle Detection file
         * In this code, file, the classical computer vision techniques have been implemented to draw boxes around the vechicles.
    * Deep Learning implementaiton using yolov3 model. 
      * Distance Velocity Estimation
* Estimation of Distance of the oncoming vechicles
  * We used our deep learning model using supervised learning approaches for estimation of distance
* Estimation of Velocity
  * We employed similar neural based approach for velocity estimation.
